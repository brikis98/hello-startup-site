    Why do so many software companies and developers give away so much of their work in the form of open source,
    writing, and speaking? Why would they invest thousands of hours and millions of dollars into a project and then
    release it for free to everyone, even their competitors? In this blog post on Y Combinator's The Macro, I dive into
    the key reasons why the best companies and developers share almost everything they do, discuss some of the common
    objections to sharing, and by the end, I hope to convince you and your company to start sharing too.
